            <small>published: 12.11.2019, 12:14</small>
            <p>I recently created a <a href="https://mad-lib-game.netlify.com/"><b>web app</b></a>. It's a mad-lib game.
              For those that have never done a mad-lib before, you'll be asked for certain words (a noun, an adjective, etc).
              Then, a short, funny story will be generated.</p>
            <p>Feel free to share it with your friends! Take a screenshot and compare funny stories.</p>

            <small>published: 12.11.2019, 12:50</small>
          <p><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bourbons-kitchen-and-cocktails-framingham">Bourbons</a> is an amazing
            restaurant located in Framingham, MA. The young owner, Luke Folley, has managed to build
            a gem of a restaurant in Framingham. Visitors can expect creative, tasty cocktails, usually in tune with the seasons.
            And the food is equally as good as the drinks. Bourbons has become a local hotspot for its service, quailty, atmosphere,
            and good Americana food.</p>
          <p>Being a huge fan of the place, I thought it would be fun to create a <a href="https://bourbons-menu.netlify.com/"><b>sample menu</b></a>
            page for some of their dishes, incorporating animation. It was pretty fun!</p>

            <h2>Partying Robot! (& Cotter, an Eccentric Millionaire)</h2>
            <small>published: 12.11.2019, 12:53</small>
          <p>I've recently finished General Assembly's free tutorials at <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">Dash</a>. One of my
            favorite projects was making a partying robot, using CSS. Your client, an eccentric millionaire named Cotter, hires you
            to build a robot that he can take with him when he goes partying.</p>
          <p>You can click three different buttons. One toggles some laser eyes for the robot. The other toggles Cotter's
            dancing (so he can take a break). The last button changes the background color. Repeatedly pressing it creates a
            strobe effect! Click <a href="https://dancing-robot.netlify.com/"> <b>here</b></a> to try it out!</p>
