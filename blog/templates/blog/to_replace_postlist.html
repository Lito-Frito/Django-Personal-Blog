        <h2>Mad-Lib Game!</h2>
        <small class="publish_date">published: 12.11.2019, 12:14</small>
          <p>I recently created a <a href="https://mad-lib-game.netlify.com/" class="project_link">web app</a>. It's a mad-lib game.
            For those that have never done a mad-lib before, you'll be asked for certain words (a noun, an adjective, etc).
            Then, a short, funny story will be generated.</p>
          <p>Feel free to share it with your friends! Take a screenshot and compare funny stories.</p>

        <h2>Sample Menu Page!</h2>
        <small class="publish_date">published: 12.11.2019, 12:50</small>
          <p>Recently, I thought it would be fun to create a
            <a href="https://bourbons-menu.netlify.com/" class="project_link">sample menu</a> page for one of my favorite restaurants.
            I incorporated some animation using CSS to make the menu more interactive for the user and create a better UX.
            It was pretty fun!</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bourbons-kitchen-and-cocktails-framingham">Bourbons</a> is an amazing
            restaurant located in Framingham, MA. The young owner, Luke Folley, has managed to build
            a gem of a restaurant in Framingham. Visitors can expect creative, tasty cocktails, usually in tune with the seasons.
            And the food is equally as good as the drinks. Bourbons has become a local hotspot for its service, quailty, atmosphere,
            and good Americana food. Definitely check it out if you're ever in the area!</p>

        <h2>Partying Robot!</h2>
        <small class="publish_date">published: 12.11.2019, 12:53</small>
          <p>I've recently finished General Assembly's free tutorials. One of my favorite projects was making a
            <a href="https://dancing-robot.netlify.com/" class="project_link">partying robot</a>!
            Using CSS animation, your client, an eccentric millionaire named Cotter, hires you to build a robot that he can take
            with him when he goes partying.</p>
          <p>You can click three different buttons. One toggles some laser eyes for the robot. The other toggles Cotter's
            dancing (so he can take a break). The last button changes the background color. Repeatedly pressing it creates a
            strobe effect! Click to try it out!</p>
          <p>Also, feel free to check out GA's tutorials at <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/">Dash</a>!. They were really
            helpful, easy to follow, and a great starting point to build my CSS & JavaScript skills with.</p>
