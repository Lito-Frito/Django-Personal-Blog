This is from the Django Girls tutorial. It uses Django to build a blog. I made my own edits to create a UI I think works better and to stylize to my preference. Check it out here:

I used SQLite for the backend & bootstrap for CSS. I added some editing, publishing, and creating buttons for superusers. There's also some privacy guards and a comment section.

Highly recommend checking out their tutorial:
