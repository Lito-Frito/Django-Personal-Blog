# Django Girls Tutorial - Build a Blog

This is from the Django Girls tutorial. It uses Django to build a blog. I made my own edits to create a UI I think works better and to stylize to my preference. Check it out here:

## Components

I used SQLite for the back-end & bootstrap for CSS.

## Features

I added some security features. Approved users can edit, publish, and create comments or blog posts. I also added a comment section. Lastly, I incorporated Google Analytics in order to keep track of engagement and traction of my site.

## Acknowledgments

Highly recommend checking the Django Girls tutorials:

I used to build the basic outline of my blog. I used the extension tutorials for the security and comment section. I then added my own unique design components and tracking features to make the site usable for users looking for a similar template.
